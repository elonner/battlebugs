# Battlebugs!

This is your classic battleship game, with a fun new twist. Instead of ships, bugs! Place your bugs on your board where ever you want, then take turns with the computer stomping each other's boards until one of you squashes all of the other's bugs. You will be notified when you step on a bug, and which bug it was. You will be told which bug you have squashed, but its position will not be revealed to you. 

New Salvo mode! Take 5 shots every turn! But for ever bug of yours that is squashed, you get one less shot per turn.

Includes a fast mode, useful for testing purposes. There is the ability to choose between three game modes and three difficulties, although not all of them are implemented at this time. The user can click PLAY or press enter to play. 

### Bug Placement

Includes the bugs to be placed off to the right. The user can select one, rotate it if wanted, and place it where they want on their board. The selected bug is highlighted. Once all the bugs have been placed, a READY button appears where the bugs were previously located and the instrucions change to tell the user they can either click the button or press enter to start the game. 

### Game Play

The active board is enlarged, the other is shrunken, instructions are displayed, and after each turn, a message is displayed indicating what happened on the previous turn. In the top right corner, you can see what game mode and difficulty you are playing. 

### Game Over

Both boards are enlarged, and the CPU's bugs which have been hidden are revealed. The user can click PLAY AGAIN or press enter to play again. If in fast mode, the user's bugs will be randomized anew. If not, the user will place the bugs again. 

### Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* Animation import

### Priorities:
* ~~Playable/rendered in browser~~
* ~~Use jQuery~~
* ~~Follows organization structure as outlined below~~
* ~~Decent UI~~
* ~~2 CPU difficulties~~ 
* ~~2 game modes~~
* Cool method to place bugs
* Playable only with keyboard and only with mouse 
* Making game pretty 
* Animations & Sounds 
* 3rd difficulty
* More game modes
* Responsive design for mobile 
* More functionality as I learn full-stack (online two-player)

At this point, there is no particular order to what is to be implemented, just whatever I feel like when I have the time.
