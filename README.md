# battlebugs

## Organization:

#### Notes:
Battle Bugs! Instead of ships, bugs. Could be unique and fun with cool animations.

Priorities:
Playable game
Different CPU difficulties 
Different game modes


### Home Screen
Different game modes (2? 3? 5?): select on home screen -- buttons or radio buttons
    Probably none that will alter the layout
Different difficulties (3?): select on home screen -- maybe up and down arrows with a slot machine type number changing in the middle
Play button

### Arrange Ships
One large grid -- grid display
Ships to the right -- grid display, keep it consistent
User places ships on their grid -- click starting and ending cell --> drag ship OR green skeleton of ship starts on the board and user can move it with the arrow keys
Begin game button
