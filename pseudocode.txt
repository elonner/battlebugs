1. declare state variables
2. define classes
    * Cell
    * Bug 
3. use jQuery to cache elements that will be referred to repeatedly
4. add necessary event listners
5. call initialize function
    * creates 2 2D arrays of Cells
    * randomly arranges CPUs bugs on its board
    * creates array of Bugs for the user to add
    * defines relavant variables
    * renders the display
6. create functions (realistically step 1 as I will do the above as I work)
    1. initialize game
    2. render the display 
        * render user board
        * render bugs 
        * render cpu board
        * render messages
        * render controls
        * render ... 
    3. handle user board setup
        * user selects bug
        * user places bug in desired location
        * renders the display
    4. handle user move
        * user selects cell to fire on
        * user fires
        * determine hit, miss, sink
        * checks for winner
        * switches turns
        * changes any other relevant data
        * renders the display 
    5. handle CPU move
        * CPU selects cell to fire on
            * difficulty 1: totally random
            * difficulty 2: ...
            * difficulty n: best battleship algorithm 
        * CPU fires
        * determine hit, miss, sink
        * checks for winner
        * switches turns
        * changes any other relevant data
        * renders the display
